<p>Welcome to AC295: advanced practical data science.

The course will be divided into three major topics: 

</p>

<p><br></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  How to scale a model from a prototype (often in jupyter notebooks) to the cloud. In this module, we cover virtual environments, containers, and virtual machines before learning about containers and Kubernetes. Along the way, students will be exposed to Dask.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong>  How to use existing models for transfer learning. Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. This could be very important, given the vast computing resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and the huge gains that these models can provide. In this part of the course, we will examine various pre-existing models and techniques in transfer learning.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong>  In the third part, we will introduce several intuitive visualization tools for investigating and diagnosing models. We will be demonstrating a number of visualization tools ranging from the well established (like saliency maps) to recent examples that have appeared in https://distill.pub.</p>

<p><hr>
<br> 
<strong>Lectures (online): Tuesday </strong> and <strong>Thursday</strong> 10:30-11:45am 
 (and possibly depending on timezone of students repeat <strong>Tuesday and Thursday</strong> from 6:00-7:15pm)
<br> 
<strong>TFs: Rashmi Banthia, William Palmer, Andrea Porelli, Shivas Jayaram, Hai Bui, Javid Lakha, Yujiao Chen</strong>

<a name='Course-Activities'></p>
<h2>Course Activities</h2>
<p>Each module is structured in three types of activities: <strong>Lectures</strong>, <strong>Reading Discussion</strong>, and <strong>Practicum</strong>. Each activity requires the students to complete different assignments in the form of exercise/homework, discussions, reading assignments, and presentations (see Assignments below). During the first weeks of each module, students will attend a lecture on Tuesday and reading discussion on Thursday. The last week of each module will be Practicum. <strong>Attendance is mandatory</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Reading List</strong> consists of papers, blogs, and other reading material that will be released no later than the beginning of each week. This will be the base for all the activities during the week. See Readings Guidelines here <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TQuPat76TSobGVAxPl4DR-68UMuME5_M66J5rkAUr-k/edit#heading=h.svo9lvagryas">link to guidelines</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lectures</strong> are held online <strong>Tuesdays</strong> from 10:30-11:45am (and possibly depending on timezone of students repeat <strong>Tuesday</strong> from 6:00-7:15pm). During this activity, we will discuss and summarize the basic concepts of the material covered during the week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Journal Discussions</strong> are held online on <strong>Thursdays</strong> from 10:30-11:45 am (and possibly depending on timezone of students repeat <strong>Thursday</strong> from 6:00-7:15 pm). During this activity, two groups will present one paper each from the Reading List to the rest of the class and lead the discussion. See Paper Presentation Guidelines here <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uvl7lc2cmSO7hLi9akVD704VHshoTVIVye-xKGT-aGQ/edit#heading=h.svo9lvagryas">link to guidelines</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practicum</strong> are activities in the form of a project based on the material covered in the module. The students will work in groups and be expected to deliver a complete assignment in 10 days. There will be two practicums.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<a name='Assignments'></p>
<h2>Assignments</h2>
<p>The <strong>final grade</strong> will be calculated using the following weights for each assignment:</p>
<p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
<p>There are eight (8) exercises to complete. They will be released at the end of each regular week <em>Lecture</em> and due a week later. The exercises are graded on a scale 1 to 5, where 5 is the highest grade.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion Forum</strong> </p>
<p>There will be a discussion forum the day before the <em>Reading Discussion</em> on Thursday based on the reading from <em>Reading List</em>. All discussions will be on the Ed Platform  (select Ed from the tab on the canvas course's main page). </p>
<p><strong>Presentations</strong></p>
<p>At every Reading Discussion, groups will present the reading material assigned at the beginning of the week.   Please see these on the presentations.</p>
<p><strong>Practicums</strong></p>
<p>There will be two practica during the first two modules (see the schedule for details).</p>
<p><strong>Final Projects</strong></p>
<p>There will be a final group project due during Exams period encompassing all the material learned in class.</p>

<a name='Getting-Help'></p>
<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>For questions about exercise, course content, package installation, and after you have tried to troubleshoot yourselves, the process to get help is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Office Hours</strong>; this is the best way to get help. </li>
<li>Post the question in <strong>Ed Forum</strong>, and hopefully, your peers will answer.</li>
</ol>
<p><hr>
<a name='Course-Policies'></p>
<h2>Course Policies</h2>
<p><strong>Collaboration Policy</strong></p>
<p>We encourage students to talk and discuss the assignments with their fellow students.  Discussion is encouraged. Presentation during Reading Discussion, Practicum, and Projects are group activities. </p>
<p><strong>Communication from Staff to Students</strong></p>
<p>Class announcements will be through <strong>Ed Forum</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Diversity and Inclusion Statement</strong> </p>
<p>Data Science, like many fields of science, has historically only been represented by a small portion of the population. This is despite some of the pioneers in computer science being from groups that are historically and presently underrepresented. Whenever possible, I will try to highlight the contributions that people have been from a variety of backgrounds. To start, here is a list of some really nice references.:
<br>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.newrelic.com/culture/black-history-month-computer-science-infographic/">7 Black Pioneers in Computer Science</a></li>
</ul>  </p>
<p>I welcome any additions to this list you may have! 
<br> </p>
<p>In an ongoing effort to foster a more inclusive environment in computer science, recent initiatives have attempted to overcome some barriers to entry for underrepresented groups:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/">Made w/ Code</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://womendrivendev.org/">Women Driven Development</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://bongohive.co.zm/">BongoHive</a></li>
</ul></p>
<p>Like the list above, this list is not exhaustive, but I welcome any additions and suggestions you may have.
I would like to attempt to discuss diversity in data science from time to time where appropriate and possible.
Please contact me (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course materials. The best way to provide anonymous feedback is to use Ed, which allows you to provide comments anonymously.
Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:
<ul>
    <li>If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Harvard records, please let me know!</li>
    <li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the <a href="https://diversity.college.harvard.edu/">Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion.</a></li>
    <li>I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.)</li>
    <li>As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>Academic Honesty</strong></p>
<p>Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in AC295 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty. As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets, but you should not split the assignments and you should work on all the problems together.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodations for students with disabilities</strong></p>
<p>Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the <a href="http://www.aeo.fas.harvard.edu/">Accessible Education Office</a>(AEO) and speak with Pavlos by the end of the third week of the term: Friday, September 18.  Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodations for students with disabilities</strong></p>
