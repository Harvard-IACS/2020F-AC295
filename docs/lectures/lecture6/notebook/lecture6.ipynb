    "- Image classification is a supervised task.\n",
    "- The number of parameters to train a CNN might be huge, thus required a lot of labeled images and huge datasets are required.\n",
    "- Luckily research groups across the globe have been working toward collecting, hand annotating, and crowdsourcing different datasets.\n",
    "- These datasets are utilized to benchmark performance of different algorithms.\n",
    "- Below is a short list of widely accepted benchmarking datasets in the field of image classification:\n",
    "    - **ImageNet:** 14M images, 20K categories, Princeton University, 2009\n",
    "    - **80 Millions Tiny Images datasets:** 80M low resolution images colled from the internet, 75K non-abstract nouns, MIT. It is the basis for other famous datasets including CIFAR\n",
    "    - **CIFAR-10:** 60K low resolution images, 10 non-overlapping classes, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. Most wide used dataset in ML\n",
    "    - **CIFAR-100:** 60K low resolution images evenly spread across 100 classes, Canadian Institute for Advanced Research\n",
    "    - **Common Object in Context (COCO):** 200K images evenly spread across different classes. It is a large scale visual database for object identification, segmentation, and captioning\n",
    "    - **Open Images:** 9M images with labels\n",
    "    - **Caltech 101 and Caltech 256:** 9K and 30K images respectively, spanning across 101 and 256 classes\n",
    "    - **Stanford Dog dataset: 20K colord images, 200 classes.** It is specific to different dog breads\n",
    "    - **MNIST:** 60K hand-labeled digits (zero to nine). One of the most famous datasets for ML"
