    "1. Install `Docker Desktop`. Use one of the links below to download the proper Docker application depending on your operating system. \n",
    "\t- For Mac users, follow this link- [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/).\n",
    "    - For Windows users, follow this link- [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)\n",
    "       Note: You will need to install Hyper-V to get Docker to work. \n",
    "    - For Linux users, follow this link- [https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)\n",
    "2. Once installed run the docker desktop.\n",

    "#### Building a Dockerfile for a Linux container¶\n",
    "1. Create a lecture2/ directory.\n",
    "Download the syllabus.md file from our web page to your lecture2/ directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Note:** Use `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Harvard-IACS/2020F-AC295/master/content/pages/syllabus.md -o syllabus.md` to download the `syllabus.md` file from the web-page.\n",
    "   - Do not copy and paste into a file on your computer.  This will give different character counts than if you download it.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Open a new file called `Dockerfile` in a text editor. Save the file to your `lecture2/` directory.\n",
    "4. Copy and paste the following lines into your `Dockerfile`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# The following line will download the latest Ubuntu Docker image\n",
    "# to use as a foundation for building our own Docker image.\n",
    "FROM ubuntu:latest\n",
    "RUN apt-get update \n",

    "# using the path that is specified second.\n",
    "COPY syllabus.md /syllabus.md\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Run `docker build -t syllabus:first .` from your `lecture2/` directory, which should contain your `Dockerfile` and `syllabus.md`.\n",
    "       - Note there is an \".\" at the end of the line. \n",
    "       - The `-t` flag tells the `build` command to tag your Docker image with a specific name. Check out this [link](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-docker-tags-9b5395636c2a/) for an in-depth explanation of Docker tags.\n",
    "       - If you choose to name the Dockerfile something else you could us: `docker build -t syllabus:first -f filename .`.  \n",
    "6. Run `docker image ls`. You should see your docker image at the top of the list. You should also see the `ubuntu` image we used to create our docker image in the list.\n",

    "#### Run a docker container¶\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are ready to start up a Docker container using the image we built. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run `docker run -it syllabus:first` in your terminal window.\n",
    "\t\t- The combination of the flags `-it` will open an interactive shell in the Docker container.\n",
    "    \t- You should see that your command-line prompt changes to `root@...`.\n",
    "8. You're now in the Docker container, which is running Linux. Use `ls` and ensure the `syllabus.md` file is in your container.\n",
    "11. In another terminal window (not the one connected to your Docker container), type `docker ps`.\n",

    "\n",

    " Depending on your OS  will give you different answers. \n",
    " - If you have a MacOS, you should see `52`.\n",
    " - If you have Windows or Linux, then you should see `51`.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",

    "### Exit and deleting \n",
    " \n",
    "15. Type `exit` in the Docker container window to leave the container.\n",
    "13. Type `docker ps` again (in any terminal window) and you should see that there are no containers running.\n",
    "14. If you would like to clean up your local Docker registry to remove images and stopped containers, [follow these instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes).\n",
