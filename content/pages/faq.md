# General
- **Do I have access to the video recorded materials if I am not an Extension School student?**
  - Yes. All AC295 students have access to all video captured materials. Extension School students also have access to live-streaming due to the nature of some members of the student body of that school. If you have any issues accessing the video content, please send an email to our helpline with your name and HUID.
- **Does the individual Exercise (EX) mean I have to submit on my own but can I still work with my HW partner?**
  - Individual AC295 EX means you are supposed to work on your own, without any human intervention, assistance, or input. You are not allowed to work with partner. You are allowed to use Office Hours (OHs) to ask questions, but we may not be able to answer all of your questions or help with all of your coding. You are allowed to use all of your materials from the course up to the EX, look at problem resolution online, and look at libraries documentation.
- **Can I make-up for forum discussion grade?**
  - No. Only 50% of forum discussion grades will count towards your final grade. This policy is to reduce stress and is in place so that missing a quiz on occasion should not affect your final grade.
- **I am an Extension School Student, can I partecipate to or forum discussion ? And do they count towards my grade?**
  - All AC295 students have access to forum discussion. If you are an Harvard Extension School student, the forum discussion will not be considered towards your final grade.

# Auditors
- **Can I audit this course?**
  - No, you cannot audit this course.
